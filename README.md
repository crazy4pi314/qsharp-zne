Playing around with implementing ZNE in Q#  (see unitaryfund/mitiq for Python implementation)


## Options for infrastructure:
- Q# library
- [x] Q# command line app
- Q# + Python host
- Q# Notebook

## What do we need to write??
- Ways to scale the noise
    - Global folding
    - local folding
- Ways to run the circuit (aka executors)
- Collect and process the noisy data (aka factories)
